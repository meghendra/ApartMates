Living in a shared apartment has a lot of benefits the biggest being low rent, but it also comes with its fair share of problems. A major problem is sharing of household responsibilities and expenses. Who will bring the groceries this week? Who will take care of the cleaning? Who will pay the cable bill this month? It becomes difficult to keep track of the many tasks that keep the apartment running. Another issue is that of one roommate taking care of most of these responsibilities and expenses. It could be too much to handle for him or her and things can go really bad if a roommate stops cooperating (a shared fine for late payment of utility bills being the least of it). It can be extremely difficult to track, delegate and share all the responsibilities and expenses in a shared house. Our cloud software application, ApartMates will bring order to this chaos. All roommates can login and immediately start sharing tasks and expenses. For more details read the [project report](https://github.com/meghendra/ApartMates/raw/master/ApartMatesProjectReport.pdf).
